# Web-Design-Challenge
Week 11 Challenge


# First, I created a new repo for the assignment files
# I then created 7 .html files for the different pages of the website. 
# I added a navbar, and customized it as requested by the assigment.
# I also added a "home image" in the navbar to act as the link to the landing page.
# I then started coding the landing html page by using bootstrap and it's column setups created.

# I then started working on the .css file to fix header font sizes, types, and colors.
# In the .css file, I changed the background color of the html page.
# I also aligned everything as I saw fit.

# Once I was happy with the index.html file, I copied the code and pasted it into the other .html files.
# I then started editing each one to reflect the information that's supposed to be on that page.

# For the data.html, I first had to read the .csv file using pandas, and then saved it to a html file using to_html attribute from Pandas.
# At the end, I had to add a Javascript code at the end of all my .html files for the dropdown menu on the navbar to wrok as planned.
